ng2bp
==============
A bare-bones boilerplate for Angular2 with ES6 and Babel.
No Typescript involved!


Installation
--------------

```npm install```


Startup
--------------

Launch ES6 transpiler watching for changes 
```npm run build```

Start development server
```npm start```
which will also open an auto-reloading browser page.


Usage
--------------
Startup the transpiler and the server in two different consoles. 
The transpiler will pick up any changes you make to files in the `es6` folder. Do **not** change files in the `js` folder, as they will be overriden.
The server will pick up changes to any file, so you can see the updated app on the browser in a matter of moments.
